### 1.Describe the difference between <script>, <script async> and <script defer>
 - Async scripts are executed as soon as the script is loaded, so it doesn't guarantee 
  the order of execution (a script you included at the end may execute before the first script file )
- Defer scripts guarantees the order of execution in which they appear in the page.
